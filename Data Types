# Program for Print Statements

# This is a comment: a comment is for humans to read and the code ignores it, you have to put a # before the comment for the code to think it is just a comment, not a command

# Printing a string: A string is another name for quotes, or something that is wrapped around quotes
print("This is a string.")

# Printing an Integer: An integer is a whole number
print(4735)

# Printing Float: A float is a decimal number
print(456.123)

# Printing a boolean: A boolean decides if something is True or False, there are only two booleans in Python
print(True)

print(False)

# End of Program
